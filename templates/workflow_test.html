<p>
Covid-19 has given us many challenges, but also provides an unprecedented opportunity for learning! We want to use this opportunity in a research setting to better understand how we adapt to the post-pandemic life and how long it takes for us to build stable routines again.
</p>

<p>
By taking part, you will be loaned a Polar fitness tracker (or may use one you already own), wear it for six months to one year, and answer survey questions once or twice a month. You will need to create your own Polar account for data.
